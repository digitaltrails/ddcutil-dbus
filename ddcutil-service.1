.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ddcutil-service
is D-Bus service wrapper for libddcutil which
implements the VESA DDC Monitor Control Command Set.
Most things that can be controlled using a monitor's on-screen
display can be controlled by this service.

.P
The
service
is registered as a
.B session-service
with the
.B dbus-daemon.
The daemon starts the service on demand.
If the service terminates for any reason, the daemon will be restart
it when it is next accessed.
Client connections with the service are stateless, each request
is handled atomically.

.SS OPTIONS

.TP
.B "--help"

Outputs options-help and exits.

.TP
.B "--version"

Outputs the service interface version and the
.B libddcutil
version and exits.

.TP
.B "--introspect"

Outputs the XML introspection text for the service and exits.

.TP
.B "--prefer-polling"

Set polling to be the preferred method for detecting display connectivity changes.
Normally polling is the a fallback used if a GPU-driver does
not support DMA or does not provide the change-detection features
required by
.B libddcutil.
Polling will probably work with any GPU.

.TP
.B "--poll-interval" \fIseconds\fP

If polling is enabled, this option defines how often to check for display
connectivity changes.  Default 30 seconds,  minimum 10 seconds, zero to disable polling.

.TP
.B "--poll-cascade-interval" \fIseconds\fP

If polling is enabled, this option defines the minimum interval between
events within a cascade of events. For example, a cascade of events will
occur when a session is locked and all displays are put into DPMS sleep.
Default 0.5 seconds,  minimum 0.1 seconds.

.TP
.B "--disable-signals"

Disable all display connectivity change detection and disable the
.B ConnectDisplaysChanged signal
sent to clients.
This cannot be reversed without restarting the service.

.TP
.B "--lock"

Make all service properties and sleep-multipliers readonly so
that clients cannot change them. This options provides a way to
lockdown the service to the configuration passed on the command line.
The lock is provided to assist with managing conflicts
when more than one ddcutil application is in use at the same time.

.TP
.B "--log_info"

Enabling log-info will produce info and debug level output.  The
output will go to standard-error or, if running from
.B dbus-daemon,
to the journal.
This option can also be toggled after startup by using B-Bus
to alter the
service's
.B ServiceInfoLogging
property (see
.B EXAMPLES
below).

.TP
.B "--ddca-syslog-level" \fIN\fP

The DDCA syslog level numerical value is passed to
.B libddutil's ddca_init()
function at startup to enable logging from within the library.
It's only available for
.B libddutil version 2.1.0
and up.
Values for
.I N
are 0:never, 2:error:, 6:warning, 9:notice, 12:info, 15:verbose, and 18:debug.

.TP
.B "--ddca-init-options" \fIN\fP

The DDCA init option is a numerical value is passed to
.B libddutil ddca_init()
function at startup to enable/disable various options with the library.
It's only available for
.B libddutil 2.1.0+.

.TP
.B -- \fIlibddcutil ddc_init options...\fP

The
.B libddcutil
library also supports its own extensive set of init options, any arguments following
.B --
will be passed as to
.B libddutil ddca_init()
function at service startup.

.SH SERVICE METHODS

The following is a brief summary of the methods provided by the service.

.TP
.B Detect
Return a list of monitors detected along with their properties.

.TP
.B GetVcp
Query a displays's settings by VCP code, for example, bightness is VCP code 0x10.

.TP
.B GetMultipleVcp
Query multiple VCP codes for a single display.

.TP
.B SetVcp
Set a display's settings by VCP code.

.TP
.B GetCapabiltiesMetadata
Query a displays capabilities returning a parsed data-structure describing the
features and permitted values.

.TP
.B GetCapabilitiesString
Query a displays capabilities returning a unparsed capabilities string.

.TP
.B GetVcpMetadata
Query the metadata describing a specific VCP code for a specific display.

.TP
.B GetSleepMultiplier
Get the display specific
.B ddcutil
sleep multiplier.

.TP
.B SetSleepMultiplier
Set a display specific
.B ddcutil
sleep multiplier.

.TP
.B Restart
Restart the service with specific arguments.

.PP
If a method requires a display-argument, either an integer
.I display-number
or a
.I base64-encoded EDID
can be supplied. Base64-encoded EDIDs are obtained from the
.B Detect
method.  If a EDID is supplied, a method's
.B flags
bit-string parameter can be set to
.B 1
(EDID_PREFIX),
this indicates a unique prefix of an EDID has been passed rather than
the entire string (this makes using EDIDs from the command line a little easier).

Run
.B ddcutil-service --introspect
for details on each method's in/out parameters. For even more
information, the
.B d-feet
graphical D-Bus debugger provides a very readable
way to browse and experiment with the service interface, simply start
.B d-feet,
select the
.B Session Bus
and search for
.B ddcutil-service.

.SH SERVICE SIGNALS

The service may raise a
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
D-Bus signal when a display undergoes a status change
due to connectivity, hot-plug and DPMS events.

Changes can be detected in one of two ways.  The most efficient method requires
.B ddcutil/libddcutil version 2.1.0+ and a GPU configured for DRM.
If those requirements can't be met, the service can periodically poll for changes.
If the requirments for the first method are met, but DRM isn't working as expected,
polling can be forced by the
.B --prefer-polling
option.    The default polling interval is 30 seconds.

Not all displays, GPU's, GPU-drivers, or cabling, provide the necessary support
for detecting connection status changes by either method.  Results may also vary
depending on the mix of desktop components,
such as KDE, Gnome, X11, and Wayland.

.SH SERVICE PROPERTIES

The service provides several D-Bus accessible properties for querying
and adjusting its operation.

.TP
.B AttributesReturnedByDetect
Query the fieldnames returned from the
.B Detect
method.  Lists the names of the fields in the order they are
found in each struct returned from
.B Detect.

.TP
.B StatusValues
Query the list of status values returned by
.B libddcutil
along with their text names.

.TP
.B DisplayEventTypes
List the event-types sent by the
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
signal along with their text names.
Events are included for display connection/disconnection (hotplug), DPMS-sleep, and DPMS-wake.
If the list is empty, the GPU, GPU-driver, or
.B libddcutil
version doesn't support display event detection.

.TP
.B DdcutilDynamicSleep
Enable/disable
.B libddcutil
dynamic-sleep adjustment of DDC timings.

.TP
.B DdcutilOutputLevel
Read/write the
.B libddcutil
output level.

.TP
.B DdcutilVerifySetVcp
Enable/disable
.B libddcutil
extra DDC calls to check whether VCP settings were actually applied by the monitor.

.TP
.B DdcutilVersion
Query the
.B libddcutil
version string.

.TP
.B ServiceMuteSignals
Set this property to \fBtrue\fP to mute the signals emitted by the service.
Any
.B libddcutil
managed event-detection threads created at service startup
will continue to run, but no signals will be emitted.  Any
internal service polling will be suspended.  Set to \fBfalse\fP
to unmute.

.TP
.B ServiceInfoLogging
Enable/disable the service's diagnostic level output to include info and debug messages.
Not that
.B libddcutil
also has a logging mechanism (see \fBlibddcutil ddc_init options\fP).

.TP
.B ServiceInterfaceVersion
Query the service interface version.

.TP
.B ServiceFlagOptions
List the available flag option values that can be passed to service methods.
Not all options are applicable to all methods.

.TP
.B ServiceParametersLocked
Returns whether the
.B --lock
command line argument has been used to make all properties and sleep-multipliers read-only.

.TP
.B ServicePollInterval
Query or set the display change detection poll-interval (minimum 10 seconds, zero to disable polling).

.TP
.B ServicePollCascadeInterval
Query or set the display change detection poll-cascade-interval (minimum 0.1 seconds).
When dealing with a cascade of events, for example, when a desktop-session is locked
and sets all VDUs to DPMS sleep, polling occurs more frequently until the cascade is
cleared.

.PP
Properties can be queried and set using utilities such as
.B busctl,
.B d-bus-send,
and
.B d-feet,
see
.B EXAMPLES.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service
If running via the dbus-daemon, this config file is read when the
service is requested.  Typically the contents would be as follows

.nf
    [D-BUS Service]
    Name=com.ddcutil.DdcutilService
    Exec=/usr/bin/ddcutil-service
.fi

Any service options, such as
.B ‐‐prefer‐polling,
can be appended to the
.B Exec=
line.

.TP
.B $HOME/.local/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service
If you do not have root access or wish to set options
for a specific user, the dbus-daemon first looks for in
.B $HOME/.local/share
before looking in
.B /usr/share.

.TP
.B $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc
When initialised at service startup,
.B libddcutil
loads options from its rc file. See
.I https://www.ddcutil.com/config_file/
for details.

.TP
.B /usr/share/ddcutil-service/examples/
The service is packaged with several example scripts, including
.B dbus-send
bash-scripts
and
.B python3
clients for D-Bus
.B dasbus
and
.B QtDBus
APIs.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The systemd utility
.B bustctl
can be used from the command line to interact with the service.

.B Summarise the service methods and properties:

.nf
    busctl --user introspect com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject
.fi

.B Detect the connected displays:

.nf
    busctl --user call com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \\
        com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface Detect u 0
.fi

.B Get the brightness of display-1 (VCP 0x10):

.nf
    busctl --user call com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \\
        com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface GetVcp isyu 1 "" 0x10 0
.fi

.B Set brightness of display-1 (VCP 0x10):

.nf
    busctl --user call com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \\
        com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface SetVcp isyqu 1 "" 16 50 0
.fi

.B Query or set the service logging level:

.nf
   busctl --user get-property com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \\
       com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface ServiceInfoLogging

   busctl --user set-property com.ddcutil.DdcutilService /com/ddcutil/DdcutilObject \\
       com.ddcutil.DdcutilInterface ServiceInfoLogging b true
.fi

.SH LIMITATIONS

The service may fail to determine working options for the
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
signal for some mixes of VPUs and GPUs (some hardware/drivers
misreport their capabilities).
If signals are not being raised, try manually adding
.B --prefer-polling
option, this option is not the most responsive, but it is
the one most likely to always work.

Some GPU drivers and VDUs have buggy implementations of DDC. If you have the choice,
a
.B DisplayPort to DisplayPort
connection may work more reliably than
.B DVI,
.B HDMI
or mixed connectors.
Different GPU driver editions, such as production, beta, and development, may
vary in the state of their DDC support.

Some
.libddcutil
parameters can only be changed at process startup.  The service can be
restarted either by killing it with a UNIX signal, or by invoking the
service's
.B Restart
method.
