.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ddcutil-service
is D-Bus service wrapper for libddcutil which
implements the VESA DDC Monitor Control Command Set.
Most things that can be controlled using a monitor's on-screen
display can be controlled by this service.

The
service
is registered as a
.B session-service
with the
.B dbus-daemon.
The daemon starts the service on demand.
If the service terminates for any reason, the daemon will be restart
it when it is next accessed.
Client connections with the service are stateless, each request
is handled atomically.

.SS OPTIONS

Depending on the version of
.B libddcutil
in use, not all options may be available.

.TP
.B "--help"

Outputs options-help and exits.

.TP
.B "--version"

Outputs the service interface version and the
.B libddcutil
version and exits.

.TP
.B "--introspect"

Outputs the XML introspection text for the service and exits.

.TP
.B "--emit-connectivity-signals"

Enable the
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged signal
sent to clients and also enable any monitoring for changes.
Once the service is running, this setting can be toggled by altering the
.B ServiceEmitConnectivitySignals
property.
See \fBSERVICE SIGNALS\fP.

.TP
.B "--prefer-polling"

Set polling to be the preferred method for detecting display connectivity changes
for the \fBConnectedDisplaysChanged signal\fP.  This is the default.

.TP
.B "--prefer-dma"

Use
.B libddcutil DMA-lookups
as the preferred method for detecting display connectivity changes
for the \fBConnectedDisplaysChanged signal\fP.  This option should detect changes sooner
with less overheads, but may fail to detect changes for some combinations or drivers and hardware.


.TP
.B "--poll-interval" \fIseconds\fP

If polling is enabled, this option defines how often to check for display
connectivity changes.  Default 30 seconds,  minimum 10 seconds, zero to disable polling.

.TP
.B "--poll-cascade-interval" \fIseconds\fP

If polling is enabled, this option defines the minimum interval between
events within a cascade of events. For example, a cascade of events will
occur when a session is locked and all displays are put into DPMS sleep.
Default 0.5 seconds,  minimum 0.1 seconds.

.TP
.B "--lock"

Lock the configuration.  Disable the \fBSetSleepMultiplier\fP
and \fBRestart\fP methods.  Make all properties read-only.
This options provides a way to
lockdown the service to the configuration passed on the command line.
The lock is provided to assist with avoiding conflicts
when more than one ddcutil-service client is in use at the same time.

.TP
.B "--log_info"

Enabling log-info will produce info and debug level output.  The
output will go to standard-error or, if running from
.B dbus-daemon,
to the journal.
This option can also be toggled after startup by using B-Bus
to alter the
service's
.B ServiceInfoLogging
property (see
.B EXAMPLES
below).

.TP
.B "--ddca-syslog-level" \fIN\fP

The DDCA syslog level numerical value is passed to
.B libddutil's ddca_init()
function at startup to enable logging from within the library.
It's only available for
.B libddutil version 2.1.0
and up.
Values for
.I N
are 0:never, 2:error:, 6:warning, 9:notice, 12:info, 15:verbose, and 18:debug.

.TP
.B "--ddca-init-options" \fIN\fP

The DDCA init option is a numerical value is passed to
.B libddutil ddca_init()
function at startup to enable/disable various options with the library.
It's only available for
.B libddutil 2.1.0+.

.TP
.B -- \fIlibddcutil ddc_init options...\fP

The
.B libddcutil
library also supports its own extensive set of init options, any arguments following
.B --
will be passed as to
.B libddutil ddca_init()
function at service startup.

.SH SERVICE METHODS

The following is a brief summary of the methods provided by the service.
Full API documentation can be found in \fBddcutil_service(7)\fP.

.TP
.B Detect
Return a list of monitors detected along with their properties.

.TP
.B GetVcp
Query a displays's settings by VCP code, for example, bightness is VCP code 0x10.

.TP
.B GetMultipleVcp
Query multiple VCP codes for a single display.

.TP
.B SetVcp
Set a display setting, specified by VCP code, to a new value.
If the method succeeds, it will also emit a D-Bus \fBVcpValueChanged\fP signal.

.TP
.B SetVcpWithContext
As with \fBSetVcp\fP but also return a client supplied context string in the
emitted D-Bus \fBVcpValueChanged\fP signal. The client context may be of
use to signal recipients for interpreting the origin of the change.

.TP
.B GetCapabiltiesMetadata
Query a displays capabilities returning a parsed data-structure describing the
features and permitted values.

.TP
.B GetCapabilitiesString
Query a displays capabilities returning a unparsed capabilities string.

.TP
.B GetVcpMetadata
Query the metadata describing a specific VCP code for a specific display.

.TP
.B GetSleepMultiplier
Get the display specific
.B ddcutil
sleep multiplier.

.TP
.B SetSleepMultiplier
Set a display specific
.B ddcutil
sleep multiplier.

.TP
.B Restart
Restart the service with specific arguments.

.PP
If a method requires a display-argument, either an integer
.I display-number
or a
.I base64-encoded EDID
can be supplied. Base64-encoded EDIDs are obtained from the
.B Detect
method.  If a EDID is supplied, a method's
.B flags
bit-string parameter can be set to
.B 1
(EDID_PREFIX),
this indicates a unique prefix of an EDID has been passed rather than
the entire string (this makes using EDIDs from the command line a little easier).

Run
.B ddcutil-service --introspect
for details on each method's in/out parameters. For even more
information, the
.B d-feet
graphical D-Bus debugger provides a very readable
way to browse and experiment with the service interface, simply start
.B d-feet,
select the
.B Session Bus
and search for
.B ddcutil-service.

.SH SERVICE SIGNALS

.TP
.B ServiceInitialized
At startup the service emits the
.B ServiceInitialized
D-Bus signal.  This signal provides clients with a way to detect a
service restart and reinstate any custom service properties or settings.

.TP
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
The service may optionally emit a
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
D-Bus signal when a display undergoes a status change
due to connectivity, hot-plug and DPMS events.

Display change-detection is optional:  detection entails some overheads;
detection may be unnecessary for display configurations that are static;
detection may not work for some combinations of hardware and drivers.

Change-detection can enabled by passing
.B --emit-connectivity-signals
on the command line, or by setting the
.B ServiceEmitConnectivitySignals
property.

To permanently enable change-detection, the
.B --emit-connectivity-signals
option can be appended to the
.B Exec
line of the
system or user D-Bus
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service
file (see \fBFILES\fP).


Changes are detected in one of two ways.
The service defaults to polling for changes by
periodically issuing libddcutil DDCA detects, this is quite
likely to work for a wide varienty of drivers and hardware.
Alternatively the service can use libddcutil to provice a more efficient method for change detection,
but this requires \fBddcutil/libddcutil version 2.1.0+\fP, a GPU configured for DRM, and
the \fB--enable-watch-displays\fP to be added to \fI[libddcutil] options\fP
in \fB$HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc\fP.

Not all displays, GPU's, GPU-drivers, or cabling, provide the necessary support
for detecting connection status changes by either method. Results may also vary
depending on the mix of desktop components, such as KDE, Gnome, X11, and Wayland.
Another issue is that DisplayPort behaves differently to DVI and HDMI when
a display is turned off but remains connected.  Lastly, some drivers that
support DMA don't properly support the necessary change detection features.

.TP
.B VcpValueChanged
The service will emit a
.B VcpValueChanged
D-Bus signal whenever a SetVcp or SetVcpWithContext method call succeeds in
changing a VCP's value.  Only changes made by service methods are detected,
changes made externally to the service are not detected and will not trigger
this signal.


.SH SERVICE PROPERTIES

.TP
.B AttributesReturnedByDetect
Query the fieldnames returned from the
.B Detect
method.  Lists the names of the fields in the order they are
found in each struct returned from
.B Detect.

.TP
.B StatusValues
Query the list of status values returned by
.B libddcutil
along with their text names.

.TP
.B DisplayEventTypes
List the event-types sent by the
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
signal along with their text names.
Events are included for display connection/disconnection (hotplug), DPMS-sleep, and DPMS-wake.
If the list is empty, the GPU, GPU-driver, or
.B libddcutil
version doesn't support display event detection.

.TP
.B DdcutilDynamicSleep
Enable/disable
.B libddcutil
dynamic-sleep adjustment of DDC timings.

.TP
.B DdcutilOutputLevel
Read/write the
.B libddcutil
output level.

.TP
.B DdcutilVerifySetVcp
Enable/disable
.B libddcutil
extra DDC calls to check whether VCP settings were actually applied by the monitor.

.TP
.B DdcutilVersion
Query the
.B libddcutil
version string.

.TP
.B ServiceEmitConnectivitySignals
Set this property to \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP to enable or disable the services's
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
signal and associated monitoring.

.TP
.B ServiceInfoLogging
Enable/disable the service's diagnostic level output to include info and debug messages.
Note that
.B libddcutil
also has a logging mechanism (see \fBlibddcutil ddc_init options\fP).

.TP
.B ServiceInterfaceVersion
Query the service interface version.

.TP
.B ServiceFlagOptions
List the available flag option values that can be passed to service methods.
Not all options are applicable to all methods.

.TP
.B ServiceParametersLocked
Returns whether the
.B --lock
command line argument has been used.

.TP
.B ServicePollInterval
Query or set the display change detection poll-interval (minimum 10 seconds, zero to disable polling).

.TP
.B ServicePollCascadeInterval
Query or set the display change detection poll-cascade-interval (minimum 0.1 seconds).
When dealing with a cascade of events, for example, when a desktop-session is locked
and sets all VDUs to DPMS sleep, polling occurs more frequently until the cascade is
cleared.

.PP
Properties can be queried and set using utilities such as
.B busctl,
.B d-bus-send,
and
.B d-feet,
see
.B EXAMPLES.

.SH SERVICE ERRORS

.SS Errors forwarded from libddcutil

Status codes and error messages from \fBlibddcutil\fP are passed back to clients as part of the data
returned by each method call.

.SS Exceptions

The service may also issue the following exceptions when attempting to set properties or call methods:

.TP
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.Error.ConfigurationLocked
The \fB--lock\fP options has prevented a client from altering a configuration
settings.  This includes using the \fBSetSleepMultiplier\fP method, \fBRestart\fP method,
 or setting any property value.
.TP
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.Error.InvalidPollSeconds
An attempt was made to set \fBServicePollInterval\fP to a value outside its accepted range.
.TP
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.Error.InvalidPollCascadeSeconds
An attempt was made to set \fBServicePollCascadeInterval\fP to a value outside its accepted range.
.TP
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.Error.I2cDevNoModule
At startup no \fB/dev/i2c\fP devices are present and an attempt to verify communications via i2c failed.
.TP
.B com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.Error.I2cDevNoPermissions
At startup it was found that the user/service lacked read/write access to the \fB/dev/i2c\fP devices.

.SH FILES

.TP
.B /usr/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service
If running via the dbus-daemon, this config file is read when the
service is requested.  Typically the contents would be as follows

.nf
    [D-BUS Service]
    Name=com.ddcutil.DdcutilService
    Exec=/usr/bin/ddcutil-service
.fi

Service options, such as \fB--emit-connectivity-signals\fP or \fB--prefer-dma\fP,
should be appended to the end of \fBExec=\fP line.

.TP
.B $HOME/.local/share/dbus-1/services/com.ddcutil.DdcutilService.service
If you do not have root access or wish to set options
for a specific user, the dbus-daemon first looks for in
.B $HOME/.local/share
before looking in
.B /usr/share.

.TP
.B $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc
When initialised at service startup,
.B libddcutil
loads options from its rc file. See
.I https://www.ddcutil.com/config_file/
for details.

.TP
.B /usr/share/ddcutil-service/examples/
The service is packaged with several example scripts, including
.B dbus-send
bash-scripts
and
.B python3
clients for D-Bus
.B dasbus
and
.B QtDBus
APIs.

.SH EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
The service relies on \fBlibddcutil\fP which
requires read/write access to the
.B /dev/i2c
devices.  See ⟨http://www.ddcutil.com/i2c_permissions⟩.

At startup
.B ddcutil-service
will attempt to verify that
.B i2c-dev
module is loaded and that the permissions for
.B /dev/i2c
are set appropriately.  If these checks fail, method calls will error until
the problem is resolved.

.SH NVIDIA PROPRIETARY DRIVER
Some Nvidia cards using the proprietary Nvidia driver require special settings to properly enable I2C support.
See ⟨http://www.ddcutil.com/nvidia⟩.

.SH VIRTUAL MACHINES

Virtualized video drivers in VMWare and VirtualBox do not provide I2C emulation.
It may be possible to forward D-BUS over \fBssh\fP to side step this issue.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The commonly available command line utilities systemd \fBbustctl\fP and
dbus-tools \fBdbus-send\fP command
can be used to interact with the service.

.fi

.SH LIMITATIONS

The service may fail to determine working options for the
.B ConnectedDisplaysChanged
signal for some mixes of VPUs and GPUs (some hardware/drivers
misreport their capabilities).
If signals are not being raised, try manually adding
.B --prefer-polling
option, this option is not the most responsive, but it is
the one most likely to always work.

Some GPU drivers and VDUs have buggy implementations of DDC. If you have the choice,
a
.B DisplayPort to DisplayPort
connection may work more reliably than
.B DVI,
.B HDMI
or mixed connectors.
Different GPU driver editions, such as production, beta, and development, may
vary in the state of their DDC support.

Some
.libddcutil
parameters can only be changed at process startup.  The service can be
restarted either by killing it with a UNIX signal, or by invoking the
service's
.B Restart
method.
